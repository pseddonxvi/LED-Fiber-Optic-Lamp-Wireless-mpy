Code for LED lamps.


# Requirements:
* Raspberry Pi Pico or Pico W
* Quick setup for Circuitpython v9: 
    * Install circuitpython (next section).
    * Copy all files in this repository onto the Pico.
    * Bob's your uncle.

# Installation
## Install Circuitpython
Download and copy the appropriate circuitpython file (version 8) to the Raspberry Pi Pico (or pico W):
* For Pico: https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/
* For Pico W: https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico_w/

The Pico will rename itself CIRCUITPI

## Copy files
* Copy files and folders from this repository onto the Raspberry Pi.
    * Note Sources:
        * neopixel.mpy: https://circuitpython.org/libraries
        * ledPixelsPico.py: https://github.com/lurbano/ledPixelsPico
* The Pico will run the code.py file by default. 
    * This program assumes you have a 30 pixel array (at GPIO15) and a touch sensor (at GPIO16).
    * It will run a rainbow pattern that turns on and off when you touch the touch sensor.

## Settings (Pico vs PicoW)
* the default _code.py_ file is designed for the Pico with a touch sensor only.
* __server.py__: is designed for the picoW, to run by default replace the _code.py_ file with this file.
